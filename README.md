# Job Openings & Applications Control API

### API to connect services to Create Job Openings and Control Applications for each Job Opening.

The API will be used by two different systems:
1. The first system was build using Bubble.io and it will host the information about the Job Oppenings, also allowing to add more Job Openings and Edit existing ones.
2. The second system was build using Appsmith and it will be used to control the applications for each active job opening.
